First Program – ‘Hello World’. Type the following:
public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.println("Hello World");
}
- Run this program by right-click on the class and select Run As Java Application.

MAIN Method: public static void main(String[] args)
- public – To make the main method accessible to the Compiler and JVM
- static – To call methods in Java we need to make objects of the class. Since this is
the main method and it needs to be called by default, we need to define the static
keyword
- void - the 'void' keyword is used in Java when the method does not aim to return a
value or hold any value.
- main - It's just the name of method. This name is fixed and it's called by the JVM
as entry point for an application
- String[] args – Main method can only accept String arguments

Comments:
Comments are ignored by the compiler but are useful to other programmers
- Three ways to comment code
> 1
/* text */
> 2
/*
The class implements an application that simply prints
"Hello World!" to standard output.
*/
> 3 // text
